# Data Carpentry (Social Sciences with R)

This repository holds the website source code for the Data Carpentry Workshop at 
North Carolina Central University on August 12-14, 2020. The workshop will be 
held online. 

Data Carpentry teaches computational skills to researchers, targeting students
and other researchers without much programming experience. This workshop will 
use example data from social science applications and will teach skills in 
spreadsheets, data cleaning (with OpenRefine), and data analysis and 
visualization (with R). 

If you're a student, you probably want to go to the actual workshop website
